A program that takes an excel file in as input, converts it to a comma separated format, and parses through it to extrapolate necessary data required to create a well-formatted employee schedule for the member service supervisors at BJ's Wholesale Club.

Before using this program, schedules had to be written out each night by the supervisors. On average, it would take about 20 to 30 minutes to do by hand each day. After the advent of this program, an entire week's worth of schedules can be processed in a matter of minutes.
